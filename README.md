# Numbers

This is the code used to work through some of the concepts in a math system where numbers are finite resolution directed segments. Numbers become typed, and feels very useful for computation.
Ultimately this will be used to try and embed concepts in AI - it feels like we work in probable ranges based on resolution, rather than specific values.

It is in progress, with some documentation here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ADCEMLMUzmGbj6_AAFuZOJkg7yRgu_4VGw2Lb8RBavE
